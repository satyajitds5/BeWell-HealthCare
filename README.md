# Problem Statement:
The global Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the necessity for a technical answer that enables medical stakeholders and emergency workers while safeguarding the wellbeing and safety of all affected. BeWell enables people to effectively control their pandemic response and reduce risk by using social isolation precautions. We recognized the need for a comprehensive system that makes it possible to safely and securely manage the logistics involved in handling a pandemic in a timely manner. Our solution gives users the ability to be "pandemic proof" against all future endemics that may occur globally.

# Proposed Solution:
The BeWell pandemic management system's goal is to control both the epidemic situation and any emergency circumstances that may develop during the course of a pandemic's several waves. Along with helping us keep track of the number of diseases and vaccination status during vaccination rollouts, this app also lets users find the services they require and broadcast their position to any emergency services they may require.

# Key Functionalities:
1. One-stop solution for user’s medical and emergency services required during the pandemic
2. Users can book doctor appointments, get notified via email and text message
3. Users can book test appointments, vaccination status, medicine order history, and status
4. Users can also report three kinds of emergencies i.e., fire, crime, and ambulance services by providing the exact location of the emergency
5. Users also have an option to donate blood during the pandemic and view their blood vitals
6. Government can view and manage vaccination requests raised by users effectively
7. Blood banks can effectively manage and maintain available blood units and blood donation requests
8. Easy patient consultation and appointment maintenance for the registered doctors.
9. Emergency location broadcasting for first responders
10. CDC officers can easily view the pandemic trends and effectively contain the disease at an early stage
11. Managing stock of the medicines/drugs in the pharmacy.
